Printed on the back are vintage wooden stretchers “Louineau, vue Vercingetorix 3 (Paris !” \n\nWear consistent with age.\n\nPotential Artist:\nAntoine Vollon (1833–1900) was a distinguished French painter celebrated for his exceptional still-life compositions and genre scenes. Born in Lyon and educated at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Vollon became renowned for his meticulous attention to detail and masterful depiction of everyday objects. His paintings often featured subjects like fruits, fish, and glassware, rendered with remarkable realism and a vibrant use of color that brought out their natural textures and luminosity. Vollon's ability to capture reflective and transparent surfaces with striking accuracy set his work apart, showcasing his technical prowess and deep observational skills. While he may not have achieved the same level of fame as some of his contemporaries, his contributions to still-life painting are highly regarded by collectors and art historians who appreciate his dedication to realism and craftsmanship.",

  "Description": "Arnt Lande for Møller & Stokke, 1940s – Upholstered in Shearling\n\nNorwegian craftsmanship, while historically rich, often did not gain the same international acclaim as its Scandinavian counterparts. However, mid-century Norwegian designers like Arnt Lande created exceptional pieces that stand as testaments to their skill. These stunning chairs are a prime example of the innovation that flourished when modernism arrived in Norway.\n\nDesigned by Arnt Lande and produced by Møller & Stokke during the early 1940s, these chairs epitomize the era’s emphasis on simplicity and high-quality materials. Constructed from pine—a local wood known for its strength and beauty—these chairs exhibit masterful craftsmanship. The sculptural spindles, arranged symmetrically, form an elegant, airy lower backrest, giving the piece a light, floating appearance despite the solid wood construction. The gently curved armrests seamlessly follow the contours of the seat cushion, enhancing both comfort and visual appeal.\n",
