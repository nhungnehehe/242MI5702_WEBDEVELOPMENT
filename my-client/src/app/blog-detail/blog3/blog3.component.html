      HOW CAN YOU MIX AND MATCH WOOD TONES IN YOUR HOME – WITH CONFIDENCE
    </h1>
    <p class="description">
      Searching for ideas on how to mix wood tones in your home? But lacking the
      confidence on where to start? When it comes to home decoration, adding
      wooden tones and especially mixing them in a space can be a bit of a
      daunting process. Questions like,where should I start? Which type of woods
      matches? And what about the application process?
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise you, all these questions are normal to have and at one point I
      had them as well – and I am still having fun and exploring with them.
      <b> What is important to remember is to have fun</b> in the process, and
      by adding different wood types into your home and by mixing them – you are
      adding a <b>powerful layer to your interior story.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, speaking of layering, not mixing woods in your home can on the
      opposite make your home finish look, appear less visually interesting; it
      is in fact through the variety of the mixing that gives that extra
      finished, what some say, designers look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's grab our confidence together and start with the simple steps in how
      to think when mixing wood.

    <p>
      Let's get straight with the basics. First of all, we need to remember
      <b>not to overcomplicate this process.</b> Like anything else, your home
      will evolve as time goes and as you learn what you also like and do not
      like the feeling of.
    </p>
    <p>
      So even if there are – yes, <b>a few rules and tricks</b> that can be used
      to help you out. And that for sure will be helpful to know of, as to get
      that more finished look that you may crave. They are not a "must" to
      follow – most importantly you should enjoy the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is the magical formula you might be asking? It is pretty
      straightforward – to some extent: the key is to
      <b>find wood types that complement</b> each other as well that adds
      contrast. And you will do this by understanding
      <b>how to look at the tone of the wood, its grains</b> and use methods on
      how to <b>apply this using some design principles.</b>
    </p>
    <h2>My Simple Steps on Mixing woods in your interior space</h2>
    <h3>1. Find your dominant wood</h3>

    <p>
      Look into your room or home now and find which
      <b>area is mostly covered in wood.</b> This usually could be the flooring,
      wall paneling, or even kitchen cabinets as an example. This would then be
      the <b>dominant wood type</b> that you should like to use, as to continue
      the steps below unless you are planning to change them out.
      <br />
      If you are starting your design from scratch then you can think of, are
      you already set on having a type of wood in larger areas of your house? If
      so, you should use this wood type as your guide continuing the steps
      below.

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px">2. Look at the undertone</h3>
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">
    Every wood type has an undertone, either they belong to the
    <b>warmer, cooler, or neutral undertones.</b>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <ul type="">
    <li>
      <b>Warm tones:</b> More reddish and should be mixed with other cool-toned
      woods
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cool tones:</b> More bluish and should be mixed with other cool-toned
      woods
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Neutrals:</b> In-between and can be mixed with both warm or cooler
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By looking at the chart above (and your wood supplier will also be having a
    more extended list of this),
    <b>you can identify which group your most dominant wood type</b> that you
    either, want or have, belong to. The reasoning is simple: the usual trick
    and guide are when mixing wood types in your room, is to
    <b>stick to woods from the same group.</b> So if you see that you are more
    leaned towards Ash, which belongs to the cool-toned group, then picking and
    mixing with other wood types with the same undertone – from the cooler
    group, will have the best result.
  </p>
  <p>
    A difference in this happens when you have a more dominant color from the
    neutral undertone group, which are woods with an in-between tone and
    therefore works to mix them with both warm or cooler tones. It is your pick,
    depending on the feeling you are after.
