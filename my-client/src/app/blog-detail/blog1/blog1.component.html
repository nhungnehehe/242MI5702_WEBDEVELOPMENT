    <h2 class="reveal">1. Modular Sofa Remains The Leading Trend</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
      Always aiming for tidiness and flexibility in arrangement, modular sofa
      designs continue to be a top favorite in 2024, becoming one of the most
      loved trends for modern living rooms in recent years. With detachable
      modules, you can easily customize the layout of your sofa in various
      configurations, such as L-shaped, U-shaped, or even as separate pieces for
      different rooms. This makes them ideal for spaces of all sizes and usage
      needs. Beyond just flexible arrangements, modular sofas enhance
      interaction among family members and create an open, welcoming atmosphere.
      <br />
      Most modular sofas feature sleek, minimalist designs, making them
      effortlessly adaptable to various interior styles, from Modern,
      Minimalist, Scandinavian, to Neo-Classical. At EVOCASA, you can explore a
      wide range of modular sofas such as BOLD, ABBEY, DELIGHT, ALTHEA, and more
      each with unique designs and refined details.

  <h2 class="reveal">2. Classic Velvet</h2>
  <p class="reveal">
    Velvet is predicted to be the standout material of 2024 due to its
    fashionable appeal and elegance. As a soft fabric with natural water
    resistance and easy-to-clean properties, velvet upholstery offers a
    luxurious and comfortable seating experience. Therefore, for rooms designed
    with a cozy and sophisticated ambiance, a velvet sofa is an excellent
    choice.
    <br />
    Additionally, pairing velvet sofas with silk or linen throws and cushions in
    light tones or smoky gray will create a more harmonious and refreshing
    space. According to interior designers, 2024 is expected to mark a
    transformation in design trends, with velvet sofas combined with
    contrasting-colored throws and cushions, bringing a fresh and youthful
    aesthetic to modern interiors.

  <h2 class="reveal">3. Almost peach</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <div id="muc3" class="reveal">
      As the color of 2024, peachy pink is highly favored and widely used in
      makeup, fashion, and even interior design. This shade exudes the warmth of
      a sunny summer day, making it a perfect choice for creating a cozy and
      inviting atmosphere. A peachy pink sofa adds comfort and softness to your
      space without feeling dull or monotonous. When paired with neutral-toned
      cushions and throws, the room achieves a sense of balance and harmony. You
      can also combine peachy pink with pastel hues leaning towards coral, moss
      green, or navy blue to create accents, adding a youthful and eye-catching
      touch to your interior

      <p class="reveal">
        Not a new trend, minimalism has remained a favorite in recent years due
        to its clean aesthetic and the sense of tranquility it brings. Following
        the principle of "Less is more," minimalist design focuses on simplicity
        and refinement.
      </p>
      <p class="reveal">
        This style often features sofas in neutral tones, particularly white,
        cream, and gray, with sleek, squared-off lines for an elegant touch. A
        key advantage of minimalism is the use of natural light, which enhances
        the brightness and openness of a space.
      </p>
      <p class="reveal">
        Minimalist sofas are typically adorned with simple, light-colored
        cushions and throws, paired with monochrome coffee tables for a cohesive
        look. To prevent the space from feeling too plain, you can add textured
        knit cushions with subtle patterns to bring warmth and visual interest
        to the design.

      Primarily blending the freshness of green with the depth of brown,
      nature-inspired tones bring a sense of calm and relaxation. Unlike the
      bold vibrancy of red or yellow, and not as simple as black and white,
      natural hues offer a perfect balance for spaces seeking a refresh without
      compromising elegance.

      natural textures brings warmth to the space, creating a perfect
      environment for relaxation. The addition of light fixtures with soft
      illumination further enhances the cozy ambiance, ensuring that every
      corner feels inviting.
