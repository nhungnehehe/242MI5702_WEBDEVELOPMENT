    { 
      question: 'Why does my planter not have a drainage hole?', 
      answer: 'Our planters are designed without drainage holes to protect surfaces from water damage. However, we recommend using a layer of pebbles or stones at the bottom of the pot to create a drainage reservoir, allowing excess water to flow below the roots.
