            <h2 class="inspiration-title">THE CONCEPTION</h2>
            <p>Our Pavilion Collection is all about delicate touches. The collection was originally inspired by our Pavilion Apartment project. We envisioned the classic wingback with a twist, accentuating the swayed lines, contouring the arms, and adding flair to the base with French bouillon.</p>
            <p>Sleek lines and delicate finesse are the main focus. With hand pulled natural webbing and a meticulous upholstery process, each chair is unique. Master upholsterers hand-pull the fabric to sculpt the interior back, giving the chair its unique shaping and lumbar support that keeps you sitting pretty.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="inspiration-title">THE INSPIRATION</h2>
            <p>Inspired by the thousands of chairs we’ve sat on that weren't quite a fit. Our Pavilion chair is everything you need to dive into a full day of reading.</p>

                        <p>“Our aim was to create an amalgamation of English classic high society style with an Italian mid-century drama for an American audience. This is our staple piece that redefines mid-century and transports you back in time” - Blair Moore, Founder of Roweam.</p>
